NAME
       suricata_analyzr - analyse file .pcap for smb protocol

REQUIREMENTS
       python3, pip, suricata >= 7.0.3-dev

SYNOPSIS
       python3 suricata_analyzr [OPTION] [ABS_PATH_PCAP_FILE] [PATH_OUTPUT_FILE<optional>]

DESCRIPTION
       Analyse .pcap file for threat Detection, monitoring, more info below.

       In MODE vibility
       -      Determine and display the timestamp of the first and last data in the file.
       -      Determine and display if private IP addresses are used in the pcap.
       -      If private IP addresses are used, display the networks used with their netmask.
       -      Using DNS queries, display the list of Windows domains present in the trace. Also, list the domain controller.
       -      Display the usernames extracted from SMB and Kerberos queries.
       -      For IPs in the internal network, extract and display the probable versions of operating systems using SMB queries.
       -      Display the TCP/IP services offered on the network with their application protocol or, if unavailable, their port. Events of the flow type can be used.
       
       In MODE detection
       -      List unique signatures that triggered alerts in the pcap.
       -      Using metadata from signatures alerting in the pcap, display the list of detected malware.
       -      List internal addresses impacted by malware.
       -      Extract and display the list of IOCs (hostnames, IPs) associated with alerts on malware.
       -      Use correlation by flow_id and tx_id to extract the list of IOCs (file hashes) associated with alerts on malware.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -d, --detection
              Mode detection described above and exit

       -v, --visibility
              Mode visibility described above and exit

       -a, --all
              Mode visibility and detection cumulated described above and exit

       -h, --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       python3 main.py -v <absolute_path_to_pcap> <absolute_path_to_config_suricata_yaml>  <absolute_path_to_rules>
              Output visiblity mode contents to standrd output.

       python3 main.py -v <absolute_path_to_pcap> <absolute_path_to_config_suricata_yaml>  <absolute_path_to_rules> <absolute_path_to_output_files>
              Output visiblity mode contents to output.rst file.

       python3 main.py -d <absolute_path_to_pcap> <absolute_path_to_config_suricata_yaml>  <absolute_path_to_rules> 
              Output detection mode contents to standrd output.

       python3 main.py --all <absolute_path_to_pcap> <absolute_path_to_config_suricata_yaml>  <absolute_path_to_rules>
              Output visiblity and detection mode contents to standard output

       python3 main.py --all <absolute_path_to_pcap> <absolute_path_to_config_suricata_yaml>  <absolute_path_to_rules> <absolute_path_to_output_files>
              Output visiblity and detection mode contents to output.rst file.

       python3 main.py --all ./../Samba-01-Trace.pcap ~/Applications/suricata/suricata.yaml ./emerging-all.rules output.rst 
              Output visiblity and detection mode contents to output.rst file. <===== USED while dev mode
